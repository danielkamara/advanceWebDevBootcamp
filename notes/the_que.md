# The Que
* An ordered list of functions waiting to be placed on the stack
* Functions in the que are processed on a first in, first out basis (FIFO)

# The Event Loop
* Functionality in the JavaScript runtime that checks the que when the stack is empty
* If the stack is empty, the front of the que is placed in the stack
