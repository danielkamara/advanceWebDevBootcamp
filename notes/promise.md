# Promise : Conceptually
A promise is an object that represents a task that will be completed in the future.
Analogy: Taking an number at a government office before you can get helped.
The piece of paper you get is like your promise. The help you get at the counter
is like the invocation of your callback.

# Primises In Practice
It is useful to understand how promises work (resolve, reject), but in practice you 
will often use promises that are returned to you.
